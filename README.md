# 🌍 Project-Arc – AQI & Traffic Density Prediction System

**Project-Arc** is an AI-driven web application that predicts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and **traffic density levels** using machine learning and deep learning models, with **location-based visualization**.

The project focuses on combining **AI models, backend APIs, and map-based UI** to deliver real-world environmental insights.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Project-Arc predicts:
- 🌫️ **Air Quality Index (AQI)**
- 🚦 **Traffic Density (Low / Medium / High)**

based on environmental and contextual parameters, and visualizes the results on an interactive map for better spatial understanding.

This project demonstrates how **AI models can be integrated into full-stack applications** for practical, real-time use cases.

## 🧠 Core Functionality

- Predict AQI using environmental parameters:
  - PM2.5
  - PM10
  - CO
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
- Classify traffic density levels based on predicted AQI
- Visualize predictions on a **map interface**
- Provide a **user-friendly dashboard** for monitoring conditions

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs or selects a location
2. Environmental data is processed
3. ML/DL models predict AQI
4. Traffic density is classified using AQI values
5. Results are visualized on an interactive map
6. Users can view real-time insights in a simple interface
